# Home Garden Case Study Analysis Index 

## Literature Review on food garden arthropod biodiversity in the Global North

**Write a literature review for home garden biodiversity** 

- Outline questions about home garden arthropod biodiversity  

- Use Google Scholar to find home garden literature

  - Read through literature and summarize their introduction, hypotheses and 
  goals, methodology, results, and conclusions 

- Answer each question outlined in the introduction

- Sources 

**Preliminary data from a case study: How biodiverse is a home garden regarding plant life?**   

- Use Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index  

  - [Calculate and graph species richness by year](Species-Richness-RMark.html)  

  - [Calculate and graph species evenness](Species-Evenness.html)  

  - [Calculate Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index](Shannon-Index.html) 

## Data Analysis on garden productivity

**Introduction**

- Summary of previous findings on garden productivity + motivation  

- Outline major questions and hypotheses  

  - What is the yield of this home garden in lbs/acre?   

  - How much of the nutritional need is met with this home garden?  

  - What is the monetary value of the garden? 

**Analysis and Results**  

- Process case study garden data  

  - [Productivity by lbs/acre](lbs-acre-calculations-.html)

- Collect nutritional data  

  - Compile nutritional data into one data table  

  - Join this to the original data set on RStudio  

  - Analyze data to answer question: Does this home garden case study provide all the important nutrients to maintain a healthy diet?   

    - Graphical analyses 

- Collect economic data  

  - Look at various supermarkets and collect data on prices of produce  

  - Join this data with the home garden case study data  

  - Analyze joint data  

    - Create graph visualizing amount of savings by year and by crop family  

**Conclusions**  

- Answer major questions 

- Outline future routes that should be taken for continued research  

- Explore hypotheses and questions
